What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you run "git init", git will add a .git folder into the repository. But it does not make a commit yet. You need to do this step because that's how it works, you can't make any commits to a non-repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is the intermediate stage, and allows us to start packing our things in there before a commit. There may be times I don't want to commit the whole directory, so the staging area allows me to pick and choose.
